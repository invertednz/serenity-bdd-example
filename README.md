Serenity BDD example project
============================

This is a simple (stupid, even) chat robot, with
BDD acceptance tests written in jBehave and Serenity.

To produce an HTML acceptance test report:

     $ gradle test aggregate

`gradle run` starts the chat robot in a Swing
window (this was for a demo with a
non-technical audience)
